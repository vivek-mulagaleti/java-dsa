## This a start of the complete DSA with java completely from the starting 
## resource used for this is Youtube ---> Kunal Kushwaha(Java+Dsa+Interview Prep course)

## Day1
    --> In the day 1 learned about the flowcharts and pseudocodes 
        -->Flowchart: representing a code in the form of flowcharts 
        -->pseudocode: not writing complete code but writing the logic of the code without considering the syntex

    -->also learned optimized method to find wheather a give number is prime or not 
        --> that method is consider a number "9"
        --- for 9 we need to check all the number less than 9 
        but in optimized method wee need to check only from 2 to sqroot(9) values.
##### how it works 
        conisder 9
        for 12 the factors are 
            1*12=12, 2*6=12 ,3*4=12 , 4*3=12 ,6*2=12, 12*1=12
                here if we observe 1*12 and 12*1, 2*6 and 6*2 are same we are checking twice for that we will check only from 2 to the "sqroot(12)" it decrease the complixity of the code

    --> solved 2 questions in leetcode its complexity was not that much good but started 
            -->Solved question is:"Two sum","palindrome"
